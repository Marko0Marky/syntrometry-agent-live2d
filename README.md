**Visualize the abstract concepts of Heim's Syntrometric Theory through dynamic 3D simulations and an AI-driven Live2D avatar, bridging theory with interactivity.**

This project presents an interactive web application designed to bring Burkhard Heim's Syntrometric Theory closer to experiential understanding. It combines real-time syntrometric state-space visualizations, an evolving emotional environment, and an expressive Live2D agent.

## ⭐ Features

- **Real-Time Syntrometry Graph**  
  3D visualization of a 12-dimensional synthetic space, reflexive hierarchy (RIH), and dynamic affinity fields.

- **Interactive Concept Graph**  
  Explore and interact with theoretical constructs of Syntrometric Theory through node-link visualizations.

- **AI-Driven Agent Simulation**  
  Using TensorFlow.js, an agent adapts its emotional states based on environment inputs and structural condensation processes.

- **Expressive Live2D Avatar**  
  The Live2D model mirrors predicted emotions (joy, fear, curiosity, etc.) and corresponding subtle head movements.

- **Metrics and Info Panels**  
  Live display of system metrics: dominant emotion, RIH value, average affinity, and environmental context.

- **Dynamic User Controls**  
  Modify system integration (I(S)) and reflexivity (Ψ) in real-time to influence the simulation.

- **Lightweight Chat Interface**  
  Inject emotional cues into the environment by typing phrases that modify the emotional space.

- **State Persistence**  
  Save and reload simulation states using browser localStorage.

## 📚 Concepts Explored

The simulation models and visualizes several Syntrometric Theory concepts, **translated for accessibility**:

- **Syntrometry** — Unified field of abstract and physical interaction via multidimensional systems.
- **Syntrix & Metrons** — The foundational entities of Heim’s structure.
- **Structural Condensation** — Recursive construction of higher-complexity structures from lower-order components.
- **Reflexive Integration Hierarchy (RIH)** — A coherence metric symbolizing internal systemic awareness.
- **Affinities** — Strength of coupling between states across condensation levels.
- **Enyphansyntrix** — Perturbative state transformations simulating discretization and dynamic change.
- **Subjective/Emotional Layer** — Environmental emotional fields influencing agent behavior.

*Note: This implementation is conceptual and intended as an educational exploration rather than a mathematically complete model.*

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Modern Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge — with WebGL + ES Modules support)
- Internet connection (for CDN asset loading)
- **Recommended**: Run through a local web server to avoid CORS issues (e.g., Python, Node.js http-server, or VSCode Live Server)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marko0marky/syntrometry-agent-live2d.git
cd syntrometry-agent-live2d
```

2. **Serve Locally**

- Python 3
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
- Node.js
  ```bash
  npm install -g http-server
  http-server -p 8000 .
  ```
- VSCode: Install the Live Server extension → Click "Go Live"

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Live2D Model Won't Load**  
→ Always run with a local server to avoid browser security restrictions (CORS).

**Visualizations Blank**  
→ Check WebGL availability: [get.webgl.org](https://get.webgl.org/).  
→ Check browser console for errors.

**Library CDN Errors**  
→ Ensure an active internet connection and inspect the network tab.

**Performance Drops**  
→ Use a dedicated GPU, close heavy browser tabs, or reduce canvas resolution.

**Other Issues**  
→ Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/marko0marky/syntrometry-agent-live2d/issues) or open a new report.
